# Giphy concentration/memory

Giphy concentration is an online version of the children's game concentration, known as Memory in Europe. It uses a search box and the Giphy API to fetch animated gifs. Build with TypeScript and Nextjs it uses serverless functions and Netlify environment variables to hide the Giphy API Key. Check it out on Vercel: https://giphy-concentration-next.vercel.app/

## Run locally
To run locally you need to obtain an key for the Giphy API [here](https://developers.giphy.com/docs/api). The program read the key from process.env.API_KEY.
You can use [netlify-cli](https://cli.netlify.com/) to use an environment variable on your local machine.
